= AME - C++ header-only DSP library for Cortex-M

AME is a C++ header-only library focused on fast audio processing on Cortex-M, such as i.MXRT. +
Specifically, AME provides a function that is missing from the CMSIS-DSP for audio processing. +

This is my back up project and also in the early stages of the project.  +
Major changes may be added to this project. +
